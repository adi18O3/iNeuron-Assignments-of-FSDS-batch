    "#### Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all ?\n",
    "**Ans:** A probability distribution describes how a random variable is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us which values a random variable is most likely to take on and which values are less likely. Based on the previous data and the occurences of the random event, we can predict the outcome in terms of probabilities. "
