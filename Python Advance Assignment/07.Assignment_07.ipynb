    "#### Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "**Ans:** **`try`** statement is used for exception handling in python. it consists of a block of risky statements which might cause an exception during runtime. if code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block if multiple except blocks are present, else it willbe reverted to the default except block. In short try and except in union avoid programs from crashing during runtime due to exceptions."

    "1. **`try`,`except`**\n",
    "2. **`try`,`except`,`finally`**\n",
    "3. **`try`,`except`,`finally`,`else`**\n",

Whereas the code inside `except` block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceeding **`try`** block.\n",

This statement takes a boolean condition output of which is True, Further Program Executes. if output of assert statement is False, it raises an Assertion Error."

    "**Ans:** **`with/as`** statement simplifies use of file handling in python. When we use a **`with`** statement for file reading, there is no need for programmer to explicitly takecare of activities like resource deallocation and file closing by using file.close() method. **`with`** statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. this avoids triggering of exceptions if file closing is unknowingly forgotten in the code execution.\n",
